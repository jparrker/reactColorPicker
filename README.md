Color picker made with react where user specifies an rgb value and we generate different shades and hues which are then displayed on the screen. Layout is controlled with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows. We use useState, onClick events, to control the input values and the color state, toast to show error and success messages, and navigator.clipboard api to allow user to copy a selected rgb value to their clipboard.
